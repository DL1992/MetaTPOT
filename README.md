# MetaTPOT
MetaTPOT code implementation

This project is the implementation of MetatPOT, a system for enhancing automatic TPOT, a machine learning pipeline generation tool TPOT. MetaTPOT is a Meta learning-based framework. It consists of a Meta-Ranker model and TPOT pipeline generation tool.
Description of the framework is available in the paper "MetaTPOT: Enhancing A Tree-based Pipeline OptimizationTool Using Meta-Learning".

This work is part of the My Msc Thesis and is strongly connected to the RankML repositery(which includes ranker implementation, featrues and more) - which will be avialbe soon
